This project aims to predict lung cancer using machine learning techniques.  It leverages various data analysis and modeling approaches to build a predictive model.

## 🚀 Features

* **Predictive Modeling:** Uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of lung cancer.
* **Data Analysis:**  Provides insights into the dataset and features influencing the prediction.
* **Clear and Concise Code:**  Well-structured code for easy understanding and maintainability.


## 🛠️ Installation

This project requires Python 3.7 or higher and several libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.  You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The following libraries are required:

* `joblib==1.4.2`
* `numpy==2.2.2`
* `pandas==2.2.3`
* `python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0`
* `pytz==2025.1`
* `scikit-learn==1.6.1`
* `scipy==1.15.1`
* `six==1.17.0`
* `threadpoolctl==3.5.0`
* `tzdata==2025.1`


## 🎈 Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** The project uses `lung_cancer_data.csv` and `dataset.csv` as input datasets. Ensure these files are in the same directory as the scripts.  (Further details on data preprocessing might be needed here if applicable).
2. **Run the main script:** Execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the lung cancer prediction model and provide results (Again, detail on the output and interpretation would be needed).


3. **Analytics:** The `analytics.py` script (If applicable) can be used for further data analysis and visualization.


## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── .git/                 <- Git repository metadata
├── analytics.py          <- Script for data analysis (if applicable)
├── dataset.csv           <- Input dataset
├── lung_cancer_data.csv  <- Input dataset
├── main.py               <- Main script for lung cancer prediction
└── requirements.txt      <- Project dependencies
```
If you want to analyse the other dataset then run:

```bash
python analytics.py
```

this will analyse lung_cancer_data.csv dataset for further use
