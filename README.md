This project aims to create a digital twin of your health, providing personalized insights and predictions.  This is a work in progress and currently focuses on lung cancer prediction.

## üöÄ  Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on provided health data.  It features a prediction engine and a (future) simulation component for personalized health management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Dependencies

The project relies on several Python libraries.  Please ensure you have them installed before running the application.  The requirements are specified in `prediction/requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r prediction/requirements.txt
```

## üì¶ Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **prediction/**: Contains the core prediction model, data, and scripts.
    - `prediction/dataset.csv`, `prediction/lung_cancer_data.csv`:  Datasets used for model training and prediction.
    - `prediction/lung_cancer_model.keras`: The trained machine learning model.
    - `prediction/analytics.py`: Performs data analysis and visualization.
    - `prediction/cli.py`: Command-line interface for easy prediction.
    - `prediction/main.py`: Main script for running the prediction.
    - `prediction/train.py`: Script for training the model.
    - `prediction/encoder.pkl`, `prediction/scaler.pkl`: Preprocessing objects.
- **simulation/**: (Future development)  Will contain scripts for simulating health outcomes based on various interventions.
    - `simulation/data/data.csv`: (Future)  Data for the simulation.
    - `simulation/simulation.py`: (Future)  Simulation script.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avirooppal/Digital-Twin-Your-Health-Replica.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the prediction directory:
   ```bash
   cd Digital-Twin-Your-Health-Replica/prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies (see "Dependencies" section above).


## Usage

To make a prediction using the command-line interface (CLI):

```bash
python cli.py --input_file <path_to_your_data.csv>  # Replace with your data file
```
(Note:  The expected format of your data must match the training data.  Refer to the `dataset.csv` for details.)

Further usage instructions and examples are available in the `prediction/README.md`.
